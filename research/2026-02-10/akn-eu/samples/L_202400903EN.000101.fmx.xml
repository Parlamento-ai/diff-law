Interoperability regulatory sandboxes should consist of controlled test environments that facilitate the development and testing of innovative solutions before such solutions are integrated in the network and information systems of the public sector. The establishment of interoperability regulatory sandboxes should aim to foster interoperability through innovative solutions by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment with a view to ensuring the alignment of those solutions with this Regulation and other relevant Union and national law, to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities and to increase the understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impact of the new solutions.
